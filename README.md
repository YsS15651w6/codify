### Running
To run it, simply open the executable you built. Running it without any arguments will open the GUI.
To run it in CLI mode, from the terminal, run it with the first argument `cli`.

### Building
Depending on your *OS*, either run `build.ps1` or `build.sh`.

### Dependencies
This app needs `glfw` and `imgui` to run in GUI mode. CLI mode can run standalone.
